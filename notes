basic process:
define a grid of n dimensions
for each grid point, assign it a gradient
- usually done by picking a random vector from the set of vectors pointing
  from the center to each edge of an n-cube (-1/1 on a line, corners of a square, etc)
  - ken did this by hashing the grid point with a precomputed permutation of [0-255]
    and using the result to pick one of the random vectors
for the point you want to sample the noise for, find its grid cell
for each corner of the grid cell, find the offset of the point from that corner, and dot the gradient at that corner with that offset
interpolate adjacent results of the previous step
- continue this down until you only get one value
- the interpolation is "linear" but the value you interpolate at is usually calculated
  with a "fade" function that is smooth
